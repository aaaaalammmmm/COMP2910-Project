Lecture 7

Apache is a web server!
M$ IIS

Apache is Open Source!
- IF THERE'S A PROBLEM IT'LL BE FOUND AND FIXED.
- Open Source has no lies and secrets! It's better. Says Jason.
NOT OPEN OFFICE. OPEN OFFICE IS AWFUL.

Apache only understands requests and responses.

Server Side languages:
Node.js, PHP, ASP, Java, Python, Ruby

Why choose PHP?
- There's huge support for it, documentation
- Lots of people make fun of PHP. It was invented by accident. It's terrible.
  - But it's OS


You can run PHP in the command line!
Apache doesn't understand PHP, PHP doesn't understand mySQL
- you install them and configure them to talk to each other

NOTE: 1.php

<?php
  echo 'hi';
  print "hi";
  $school = 'bcit';
  echo $school;
  echo '$school';             //$school
  echo "$school";             //bcit


?> (it's more efficient to leave this out)

NOTE: form.html
<form action="form.php" method="get">
  <input type="text">
  <input type="">
</form>

NOTE: form.php
<$php

echo $_GET['x'];

$_GET
$_POST
$_REQUEST (post or get)

NOTE: files.php
<?php

$f = fopen('books.txt', 'w') or die('error');

fwrite($f, "Getting to Yes" . PHP_EOL);
fwrite($f, "Four Hour Workweek" . PHP_EOL);
fwrite($f, "Getting Real - 37 Signals" . PHP_EOL);

fclose($f);

$lines = file('books.txt');

foreach($lines as $line) {
  echo nl2br($line);
}

NOTE: regex.php

<?php

echo preg_match('/a/', 'bcit');
// ^ $ + * ? . []
/a+ - one or more of previous regular group
(ab)+
a* - zero or more of preceeding char
a? - zero or 1
. - any single character
. * - any number of characters
[] - character class (list or range), [aeiou]
[a-z] - range any single character
[a-zA-Z0-9_-] - any character in ranges, a-z, A-Z, any digit, underscore, or hyphen
[^aeiou] - not aeiou

ESCAPE: \/, \\, \]

Canadian postal codes:
/^[a-z]\d[a-z] ?\d[a-z]\d$/i


NOTE: sessions.php
<?php
session_start()
- creates / continues session
- creates:
  - session id
  - server file with that name
  - sends id to client
- client makes another request with id, continues session
- sessions are not secure by default in php
- HOW DO WE MAKE SESSIONS MORE SECURE?
- sometimes session id is stored in URL.
- secure sessions.


$_SESSION['username'] = 'jason';


?>

all arrays in php are associative (k, v)

Jason is going to use mySQL

NOTE: student.sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS bcit;

USE bcit;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student
(studentNo VARCHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL
,firstname VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
,lastname  VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
,dateborn  DATE        NOT NULL
,email     VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO student(studentNo,
                    firstname,
                    lastname,
                    dateborn,
                    email) VALUES ('a12341234',
                                   'jason',
                                   'harrison'
                                   ...);
UPDATE student
SET emailaddress=".....";
WHERE studentNo
LIMIT 1;

SELECT *
FROM student;



//find server

NOTE: student.php
<?php

$db = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'com', '2910') or die(mysqli_connect_error());

mysqli_select_db('db', 'bcit');

mysqli_query(db, "......QUERY......");
