Ideation
- The formation of ideas

Methods of Innovation
- Derivative ideas
  - you're copying someone else.
- Symbiotic (combined) ideas
  - TAKE TWO DIFFERENT IDEAS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER.
- Revolutionary ideas
  -
- Serendipitous discoveries
  - Things that pop up out of nowhere! Aiyoy.
- Targeted innovations
  - WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
  - We've been challenged to produce applications that motivate people to
    reduce food waste to zero. yay.
- Computer-assisted discoveries
  - We dumb, computer smart.


Research
- Prelude

    - Other municipalities
      - Find other municipalities that have done this, how have they succeeded / failed
    - Health Canada
    - App stores

    - Conversations
    - Observations

Brainstorming "Old Faithful"
1) Define the problem

6. Recipes
7. Impact
8. Restaurant apps
9. Meal planning


Aleatory techniques
- introducing randomness
- random dictionary words
- random object
- roll dice and flip coins

Mind Mapping
- concept diagram
- associations
- starts with a central idea
- expands outwards

Be SMART
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-boxed
