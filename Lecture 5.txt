D'arcy can't make sexy UIs.

User-centered Design
- 20% of apps get used only once
- 60% of apps get used <12 times
- MAKE USERS WANT TO USE YOUR APP.
- the target audience is the USER.

COME UP WITH YOUR OWN VISION
WHO are you making it for?
WHAT problem are you trying to solve?
WHERE are you building it?
WHY should anyone care?
HOW will it fulfill a need?

DESIGN RULES: Things to check on EACH screen you create
1) Create a visual language (be consistent)
   - BUTTONS LOOK LIKE BUTTONS
   - Only clickable things should look like that button
   - Highlight selected items in the same way every time
   - Don't use colour one time and an underline another
   - Thinking is bad. (if your user has to figure things out, it's bad)

SPECIFICALLY FOR MOBILE
STANDARDS
- few standards for Android
- iOS has standards
- COPY STUFF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE.

SMALL SCREEN
- only show users what they need to see now
- don't want users to zoom/scroll/pan

GESTURES
- don't cross gestures

TEST

START WITH SMALL AND THEN GO BIG
